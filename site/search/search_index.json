I've been unicycling since Sept 19th, 2021 (Almost 3 years as of when I am writing this) when I discovered my college club (CPUC) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Since then, I have consumed years worth of unicycle YouTube content, attended every possible NAUCC and Muni Weekend, managed the club Instagram, served as CPUC club president in 2023-24, and coordinated the first Memorial Day Unicycle Weekend event in CA.</p> <p>I would say my signature trick is coasting, which I continue to refine and will hopefully truly master one day. This had been a dream trick for me since the very beginning, and it has fundamentally shaped by journey thus far. </p> <p>I couldn't have possibly reached where I am today without help from my fellow club members, local riders, NAUCC/Muni Weekend participants, and the online unicycling community. Hopefully through the Uni Bible, I can give back some of the hype, encouragement, and advice I have received.</p>"},{"location":"About/#where-to-find-me","title":"Where to find me","text":"<p>Feel free to reach out to me or check out some of my riding on instagram or YouTube.
