,,Category/Tag,Definition,,,,,,,,
,,balance,under category of position! Requires active balancing,,,,,,,,
,,basic,simple trick that either forms the foundation of no other trick or too general to be a useful category/tag,,,,,,,,
,,coast,wheel revolves on ground with no foot/hand contact on pedals/cranks/tire,,,,,,,,
,,flip,wheel revolves in the air with feet off pedals (crank flip),,,,,,,,

,,jam,foot lodged onto tire&frame or crank&frame,,,,,,,,
,,mount,trick involves mounting the unicycle,,,,,,,,
,,pedal push,pushing the pedal,,,,,,,,
,,pirouette,"Uni and body, in place, spinning round a vertical axis and having contact with ground",,,,,,,,
,,position,is a place to be and not a movement,,,,,,,,
,,prefix,"not a trick on its own, but added before a trick name to indicate direction of travel, seat position, etc.",,,,,,,,
,,rev,wheel revolves in the air with feet on pedals,,,,,,,,
,,ride,"Pedaling stuff (examples: sideride, crossed feet seat out back, outsiderollride, seat out onefoot toeslide) ",,,,,,,,
,,roll,wheel is propelled through a combination of feet on cranks/pedals and tire,,,,,,,,
,,spin,unicycle spins relative to the ground,,,,,,,,

ADDITIONAL RULE: DON'T DELETE ANY ENTRIES!,,Conventional Grammar Rules:,,,,,,,,,
"The whole point of a dictionary is to define language based on usage. Even if you think no one else uses that term, if somebody and that person's friends uses that term, it belongs in the dictionary. Don't agree? MAKE A NEW LISTING!",,"If trick is a combination of different tricks, the name word order should follow this order of categories:",,,,,,,,,
,,,"direction of travel, late, seat position, varial, Â° unispin, leg wrap type, (#) flip(s)/spin/grind",,,,,,,,
,,"Examples: Fakie Late Trey Side Double Flip, Static Inward Small Side Spin, Rolling Out 540 Anti Side Spin",,,,,,,,,
,,NOTES:,,,,,,,,,
,,"""flip"" and ""grind"" are often left out of trick names",,,,,,,,,
,,"unispins are often abbreviated by the 1st number of the degree of spin (e.g. ""5 spin"" = 540 unispin)",,,,,,,,,
,,"numbers referring to flips are in the tuple form of double, triple, quad, quint, etc.",,,,,,,,,
,,"spins combined with a flip, take the ordinal form of fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth, etc. (refering to 540, 720, 900, 1080, etc)",,,,,,,,,
,,EXCEPTIONS:,,,,,,,,,
,,"""Fakie Flip"" comes at the end of a trick name, so direction of travel is not included at the beginning of the trick name 
(ex: Full Out Back Side Fakie Flip)",,,,,,,,,
