definition: Begin in outside roll position. After the first push (one half rev roll forward), with the seat in front of you, twist your body away from the unicycle in a 180 body varial and place your back foot on the other crank in the inside position. Then use your front foot and brace it against the tire while you continue the body varial to make it 360. during this transition you switch your back foot around on the same crank to be in the outside roll position. Then finish the roll by moving the last half rev forward on your back foot. Whew. That's a long description. Intimidated yet?
