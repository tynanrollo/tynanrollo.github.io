alternate: back rolling wrap, reverse rollingwrap
category:

tags:

definition: starts similar to a backroll, but your hand should be on the handle of the seat. after the first half roll backward, the free foot (front foot) goes to the other crank. The seat is passed behind your back to your other hand and there will be a moment when both feet are on the cranks and both hands are on the seat. Then pass the seat to your other hand as your front foot rolls the second half revolution backward (this may sound like a very complicated explanation but just imagine a rolling wrap in reverse)
