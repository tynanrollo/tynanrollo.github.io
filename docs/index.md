# What is the Uni Bible?

> !!! TIP "Welcome!"
>     Hey! Welcome to the Uni Bible! 
>     
>     I hope you enjoy your stay here, while wandering and exploring inside my unicycle brain. 
>     I wrote this with the help of my college unicycle club with the intent of gathering our knowledge in an organized, centralized location to pass down to the next generation of student riders. 
>     
>     With support from the unicycling community, including the incredibly talented riders I met at UNICON21, I hope to make this online resource accessible for riders of all skill levels, disciplines, worldwide.

> !!! warning "HELP NEEDED"
>     Taking a few minutes to contribute your unicycling knowledge to the community can go a long way to make this resource more useful and complete. Details included below in the "[[index#How you can help|How You Can Help]]" section. 

## The Vision

A massive, interconnected, clickable graph of existing unicycling tricks, showcasing:
1. what tricks exist, and how they are related
2. prerequisites you can learn to work towards your dream tricks
3. links to all the best tutorials and tips from the community for each trick

all in a fun and engaging environment.

The graph in the picture above is what I could come up with off the top of my head, but with help from the community the graph can include a lot more tricks. That view was rendered in the obsidian notetaking app (setup tutorial coming soon), which has more customizability than the web version.

## Progress so far

Populated every trick from [Noli's Tricktionary Excel Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkBw37AB-pdIh4j6a76rBraM02kYZacu4rtGyOrLdh8/edit?gid=0#gid=0) into this website as individual files that can be searched and clicked, including embedded videos. Check out the [[docs/Noli's Tricktionary/Brill Whip|Brill Whip]] page as an example.

Notice that linking the Brill Whip page to this home page added a link in the interactive graph view. Feel free to drag and play around with it (top right of the screen). Clicking the icon will take you to the complete graph view. Additionally, each trick now has a local graph of adjacent tricks, which can be good inspiration/prereq recommendations.

> If having trouble seeing the nodes on the graph view, try switching to dark mode and back using the slider above the search bar.

## How you can help

I have populated links between prerequisite tricks, as shown in the interconnected image above. You can help add more links by entering trick names into the new "Prerequisite Trick" column of the [Noli's trick spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkBw37AB-pdIh4j6a76rBraM02kYZacu4rtGyOrLdh8/edit?gid=0#gid=0). I can run a script to update the spreadsheet info into the Uni Bible. Additionally, this will help flush out outdated video links currently in the spreadsheet.

### Spreadsheet Entry Directions
If there are multiple prerequisites, make sure:
1. entries are separated by commas
2. ==match the spelling of the trick elsewhere in the spreadsheet==
3. include only the immediate prerequisites (the chain of prerequisites will form automatically)
	- Ex: the prereq for one foot coast is one foot ride. don't include riding as a prereq for coasting because it is a prereq for one foot ride.
