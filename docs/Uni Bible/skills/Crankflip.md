## (Eli Brill) Tips

![Brill School Ep5: Crankflips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1csgQAh6Y)
* toes on pedals

* Stand up half rev before flip
* Pull hard on saddle, lot of pressure
* **==Flip is mostly about back foot==**, tap front pedal a little
* Land back foot on pedal and front on crank for rolling out
	![[Crankflip.png|375]]
* For confidence, **first land with one foot on crank**
* Also recommends **==zero plants==**

## Jack Sebben Tips
![Crankflip Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0HemhQd_2E)
* Master prereqs:
    * No footers -> revs -> zero plants (for technique)
    * aerials/no footers: no footer = tire off ground. 
        * Build up to splits
    * rev/half rev
        * Try crankflips as half rev with one foot, removing back foot
        * Helps to ride moderately fast to get full rotation
    * Zero plants
        * Plant back foot on ground/elevated platform
        * Time swing of unicycle with rotation of pedal
* Common issues:
    * Not flipping cranks
        * Not trying to **==go down and out while kicking cranks==**, making legs straight
	        ![[Crankflip-5.png|250]] ![[Crankflip-6.png|300]]
    * Curve in to front foot for more snap
    * With 45 degree snapping position, equal pressure on pedals can still generate snap
	    ![[Crankflip-4.png|375]]
    * Feet stuck to front pedal, not getting full rotation
        * Focus on kicking foot down and out
        * Look at your no-footers, should go out rather than up
