> Hey! Welcome to the Uni Bible! 
> I hope you enjoy your stay here, while wandering and exploring inside my unicycle brain. 
> 
> I wrote this with the help of my college unicycle club with the intent of gathering our knowledge in an organized, centralized location to pass down to the next generation of student riders. 
> With support from the unicycling community, including the incredibly talented riders I am meeting at UNICON21, I hope to make this online resource accessible for riders of all skill levels, disciplines, worldwide.

## About the author
My name is Nakul Mohakar, and I am a flatstyle/street rider from California, USA. I've been unicycling since Sept 19th, 2021 (Almost 3 years as of when I am writing this) when I discovered my college club ([[CPUC]]) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Since then, I have consumed years worth of unicycle YouTube content, attended every possible NAUCC and Muni Weekend, managed the club Instagram, served as CPUC club president in 2023-24, and coordinated the first Memorial Day Unicycle Weekend event in CA.

I would say my signature trick is [[Uni Bible/skills/One foot coast|coasting]], which I continue to refine and will hopefully truly master one day. This had been a dream trick for me since the very beginning, and it has fundamentally shaped by journey thus far. 

I couldn't have possibly reached where I am today without help from my fellow club members, local riders, NAUCC/Muni Weekend participants, and the online unicycling community. Hopefully through the Uni Bible, I can give back some of the hype, encouragement, and advice I have received.

## Where to find me

## Obsidian
This page and layout were created in Obsidian ([Website Link](https://obsidian.md/)), an incredibly flexible and powerful writing/notes app. Would highly recommend if you are a student or professional trying to keep track of a large volume of information. Steep learning curve and high skill-cap, literally built for unicyclists.
