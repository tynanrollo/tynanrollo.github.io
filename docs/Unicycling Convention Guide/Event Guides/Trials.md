# Trials

* Trials is often done in multiple groups of riders

    * If there are multiple groups, will you be separating them in advance?
    * Can riders ask to change groups?

* Rider Briefing

    * When are riders being briefed?
    * What about late-arrivals?
    * Remind the riders about any special rules (e.g. about changing from Beginner to Advanced, or about the "1/2 point hand rule" (NAUCC rule))

* There need to be many judges, in order to judge all of the stations

    * Do you have water available for the judges?
    * Are you ensuring that the judges have a break for the bathroom?
    * Shade/sunscreen?
    * Note: The judging must be consistent, so don’t replace a judge at random.
    * Each judge should have a pen

* Trials is usually scored with a scorecard

    * This is "cardstock" (hard paper) printed with a space for each obstacle
    * Each scorecard MUST have the competitor’s ID number on it
    * The judge signs each one on completion
    * Where will the competitors give their scorecards when they are done?

* Scoring

    * Someone to add up the results
    * Someone to double-check the addition
    * Someone to enter the results
    * Someone to double-check the entry

* Tie Breaking

    * Tie breaking needs to be on the schedule as a separate item, so that there is sufficient time to tabulate the scores, and determine who needs to tie-break.
