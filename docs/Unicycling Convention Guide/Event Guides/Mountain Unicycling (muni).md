# Muni

## Before the competition

* A muni course assistant (or director's designee) must ensure by riding a mountain bike or unicycle or walk the entire course from start to finish and ensure that the course is ready and unambiguous for whomever is racing it (e.g. for an average 8-yr old), if it is a "beginner" course.

## Other considerations

* Do you have garbage bags/cans for garbage (lunches)

* Have you set up the course to be sufficiently long?

* Where is medical?

* When do the busses run?

* Course Instructions

    * Ensure that the Start Line Volunteers know that they must remain open until the end of the Scheduled time (even if there are no competitors in line to run the course, the course should stay open until the end of the scheduled time).

* If recording with paper/stopwatches

    * Do you have enough clipboards?

    * Do you have enough accurate/good stopwatches?

* If recording with chip system

    * Ensure that you have paper recording backup of an accurate time of day of the start, and of the end (so that we can fall back on this in case of chip-failure/etc)

* Volunteers

    * Do you have cell reception here?

    * Share out everyoneâ€™s phone numbers, so that we can contact the different courses

* Judges

    * Do you have people along the course to ensure that the rules are followed?

    * To ensure that people do not get lost

    * How will these judges communicate back with the organizers if they determine that someone broke the rules?

* Are the directions from the main area to each of the courses clear?
