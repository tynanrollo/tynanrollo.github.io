# High Jump/Long Jump

* Do you have extension cables to reach to the desks

* Do you have desks

* Laptops

* Shade, so that you can see the laptop screens

* Mouse (people may not know how to use a trackpad)

* Paper/pens, for backup recording

* Metric-measuring device (centimeters, not inches)

* The course should be marked out and set up for competition at least 30 minutes before the start time of competition. This allows time for the volunteers to be trained.

* Do you have the space required by the rulebook?

* Do you have the measurement/fault markers necessary by the rulebook?

    * What is the minimum jump distance possible on the equipment?
    * what is the length, thickness of the measurement device (see rulebook)

* When will tie-breakers occur?
    * We often do tie-breakers for overall jump winners, so that we don't give out multiple medals for a competition.
        * Rules for tie breaking should be in rulebook and/or published decided ahead of time
    * Is this on the schedule?
    * Do competitors know that they should be prepared for tie-breakers?


* Each line should have FOUR volunteers (2 line judges, 1 coordinator/manager, 1 data recorder)
