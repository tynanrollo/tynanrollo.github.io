# Road Racing

* When doing a road-racing event where the roads are closed by the police, please ensure:

    * A volunteer at every intersection and pedestrian crossing to prevent people from walking onto the course. (Ensure that this is someone who speaks the local language)
    * Known location of medical
    * Known location of water

* What time is check-in?
* What time do unicyclists line up?
* Will there be multiple waves of competitors?
  * How to communicate the waves to competitors?

# 10k

* Where are the bathrooms?

* Where can people leave backpacks during their race? (a secure area)

# Marathon

* Similar to the 10k

* Where are the bathrooms?

* Where can people leave backpacks during the race?

    * If the Start location is not the same as the Finish location, is it near enough to have the competitors return here?

    * Who will be managing this?

    * How will you secure them? Trust-based, or with Competitor-ID tags?

* How will you handle people who crash on the course and need to be taken to the hospital?

    * Ie: people who faint, or are injured?

    * Do you have a way to communicate with your volunteers around the course?

* If itâ€™s a multi-lap race, will you allow competitors to quit the course early and get partial credit (e.g. 3 of 4 laps, gets ranked along all 3-lap people). If so, you must publish this in advance (in the program book?)
