# Stillstand/Slowraces

* Many volunteers are required

* Stopwatches are required

* The average time between the 2 stopwatches is entered into the system.

    * You will need a laptop/volunteer just to create the averages, and another volunteer to enter this into the db.

    * The entry of data can be the bottleneck with people who do 5 second attempts.
