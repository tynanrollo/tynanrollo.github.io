# Hockey/Basketball

* When will the teams be set?

* Do you have the necessary equipment?

    * Whistles
    * tennis balls
    * Pinnies
    * Scoring cards/boards
    * Shared hockeysticks for the "Pickup" Team
        * These should be clearly marked, so that pickup members know which sticks they can use (and which they cannot)

* Competitors want to know which days that they will be playing so that they can schedule going to other events/places.

    * When will the schedule with teams be set?
    * How will this be communicated with the competitors?

* Playing on a concrete floor is not a good idea, as it has led to a number of broken bones at UNICON because it is so hard

* When reviewing the venue, work out which lines will be in-play/out-of-play (for basketball especially)

* It is the responsibility of the Director to ensure that all members of each team are properly entered into the system

    * We need to know who is playing on each team in order to:

        * properly award the correct people
        * Prevent non-competitors from playing on teams
        * Prevent competitors from playing on multiple teams

* Ensure that the roster of each team is fully and accurately entered into the system.

    * This should occurs before the end of competition, preferably before ech team plays a game, so as to verify the membership.

* Who is the referee from each team?

    * In order to have a smooth running tournament, we must have enough referees. The rules specify that each team must provide a referee. We should know these people's names BEFORE the competition starts, so that each referee can be contacted to ensure that they know they will be refereeing (and have reviewed the rules)

* If the director is also a member of one of the teams, the director must designate a non-playing person to coordinate the games and teams.
    * For scheduling reasons, it is important that the games run as quickly one-after-the-other as possible, and having someone coordinate this is best.
    * Recording the scores, win/loss is important to be centralized
    * Coordinating the referees for each game is necessary, so that games can start as quickly as possible.

* Pick-up teams

    * Some competitions allow people to sign up without specifying a Team or Captain, with hopes that there will be enough other people who want the same to build a team.
    * In order to field a Pick-up team, there should be at least 2 extra players than the minimum required. (e.g. If the game requires that 5 players be on the court at once, the pick-up team should have no fewer than 7 members)
    * The Director should reach out to the pick-up team registrants in advance of the competition, and confirm whether they are coming to play

* Scoring

    * Scoring should be done by a non-player at least 14 years old.
