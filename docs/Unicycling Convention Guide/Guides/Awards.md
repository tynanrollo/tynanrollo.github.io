# Awards

* What kind of medals/ribbons do you want to have?
    * Usually there are 2 different types of awards
        * One for common (age-group) results
        * One for expert (age-group-agnostic) results
    * There may also be additional rewards, e.g. Trophies, necklaces, etc.

* What is the lead-time for the manufacturer?

* Can you get a "Proof", to ensure that everything is spelled properly?

* In order to determine the number of medals you need, you need to:
    * Set the events list
    * Set the age groups for each event
    * Determine which events get "Expert" medals

* Is there any space on the award for putting a label, to identify who won it, and what their result was? (e.g. "Robin Dunlop - 10k Unlimited - 28:22 - 3rd Place")
    * Do you have the labels necessary to print on for the awards?
