# Unicon Traditions

* There are some traditional aspects of Unicon:

    * Directors T-Shirts

        * Usually the directors get T-Shirts which are a different color than the normal Registrant T-Shirt. These are provided to the Directors for free.

    * Organizer T-Shirts

        * Often the event organizers (the critical ~5-10 people) also have a shirt, which is a different color again. It is nice to give these people more than 1 of these shirts, as these people are usually "Working" every day, and may not have much time to do laundry.

    * Final Party

        * After the last event, there is often a party scheduled, at which:

            * "Overall" awards are given out

            * Any remaining awards are given out

            * Recognition is given of various critical people, possibly giving them physical goods (sometimes we give away any remaining 1st place medals by doing this).

        * It is usually a good idea to have some schedule to this party, to ensure that people know when the "planned" part is over, and when the remaining time is just “Music with people hanging out”, etc.

        * Sometimes Food is also provided, which may cause this event to also become a "for sale" item on the registration.

            * If so, be sure to plan for garbage cans/bags and for someone to empty the garbage cans in a timely fashion.

            * If food is provided, make it clear whether people can attend the final party even if they are not eating food

* Podiums

    * Having some sort of podiums for use when giving out awards is nice. They should be portable, so that they can be moved to where the awards are being given out.

    * Sometimes there are multiple events running simultaneously (or very nearly simultaneously), and having 2 sets of podiums would be useful.

        * When you are scheduling the awards in the program book, taking travel time/etc into account is useful. **Note:** always plan on the previous event running late.

* Wristbands

    * A wristband for each registered Competitor is expected.

    * This should be a fabric-style wristband, with a metal-bound clasp (usually a clamp-style clasp), so that it cannot be easily removed.

    * This identifies this person as a competitor, who is allowed access to areas

    * If you are also selling bulk lodging (like a school), you may choose to have a 2nd color of wristband which identifies registrants who are allowed access to the school.
