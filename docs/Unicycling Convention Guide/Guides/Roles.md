# Roles and Responsibilities

Creating/maintaining consistency with roles - I see references to Event Host and Directors and Organizers.

## What are the responsibilities of each role?

* Are they clearly spelled out?
* Does each person understand the chain-of-command and know their limit of authority?
* Are things understood/planned well enough (in advance) so that one person doesn't end up needing to be involved at every step the day of the event?

## Specific Duties

Officials (for some events) have specific duties in the rules.

* Who names the Officials (Host? Organizer? Director? Director of Competitions?)
* Are names of officials published (Chief Referee, Chief Judge) for each event?
* Does everyone know what their roles are, as opposed to the role of Director?
* Some "volunteers" are actually officials (line judges for trials, for example). Do they know what their duties are? Are they adequately trained?

## Protests

Protests - this is a problem area within the rules, since there are some contradictions. This hopefully will be ironed out in the next Rulebook committee. However, in terms of this guides, some additional considerations are:

* where are protests filed?
* what is the time-limit of protest?
* how will people know that results have been posted, and where, so they know when the protest time starts?
* how are protests resolved and who communicates back to the person?
* are protests archived and for how long?
