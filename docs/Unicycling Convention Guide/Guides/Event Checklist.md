# Event checklist

For every event, some questions should be answered.

* Where are the bathrooms

    * Are there enough? (For races, everyone wants to go before they race)
    * Is there enough toilet paper? Where is more?

* Where are the garbage cans?

    * Are the garbages large enough? Do you need extra bags?
    * If you are going to stay here for a meal, the bags will probably fill

* What are your rain plans?

    * Do your volunteers have umbrellas/ponchos?
    * Will your sign-in papers get wet/broken?
    * What is your backup time/location? (so that you can announce it, if you need to go there)
    * Have you announced your rain plans in advance (in the Program Book?)

* When will awards be given out?

    * This should be on the printed schedule, including location of awards
    * For events with a lot of data, we recommend 24 hours for protests/issues.
    * For events with battles/etc, you can do the awards immediately, and enter the results officially after the event
    * Do you know where the podiums are (if applicable)

* Do you have a place for final storage of all judging results

    * Usually this is an envelope to hold all results written by judges/officials

    * Once the data is entered into the official record, this envelope may become the property of the convention-results-official.
