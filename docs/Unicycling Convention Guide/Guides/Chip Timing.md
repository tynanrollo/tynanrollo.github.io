# Chip Timing

Using a electronic chip timer (with RFID chips and timing mats) is sometimes a very good option, depending on the event/venue.

* Timing Provider must handle any issues

    * Must provide RAW files to the event, so that any lookup issues can be resolved as quickly as possible

* Timing provider must be prepared to resolve disputes as soon as possible

* Video camera of the finish line should be present, and provided.

* Do you have a clear boundary around the chip timing area to ensure that people don’t have their chip counted twice?

* Is the system configured to ensure that it can read the numbers when mounted/running over top.

* Experience with chip systems:

    * Some Chip systems are really good, some are really bad.

    * The chip-detector can usually be configured in 2 ways...the first-time that a chip was detected, and the last time that a chip was detected (because sometimes a chip is within the area for > 2 seconds). We usually always want the 1st time the chip was detected….but this also means that all Start Mats should be far enough away that when mounting to start the course, they don’t set off the mat.
