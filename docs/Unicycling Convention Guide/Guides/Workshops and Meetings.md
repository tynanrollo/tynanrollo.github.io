# Workshops/meetings

* Where will they be held?

    * Chairs?

* Do you need/have a projector/screen?

* Do you need a microphone/sound system?

* How will the workshop schedule be publicized? Will there be workshops added after the convention starts?

* Do you have a backup location in case of weather?

* If the workshop is something which travels (like a tour, or a publcrawl) there should be a posted phone number of someone on the tour, so that people who arrive late can meet up with the tour.
