# Guides

Different aspects of a convention need different questions asked/answered. This collection of documents is an attempt to ask these various questions

## Goals

- Provide a checklist for Convention Organizers, to ensure that they have reference for what they should be doing in advance
- Provide a checklist for each Event Director, so that they can review it to ensure that they haven't forgotten to think about anything.
- Provide a checklist for various other Roles, so that we can refer to it when giving instructions/communicating
