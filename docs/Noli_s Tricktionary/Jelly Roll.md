definition: Begin on your front crank in outside crank position. Roll forward half revolution and rotate your body away from the uni (e.g., if you ride right foot in front, you will turn to your right) Your free leg goes over the tire, between the frame and your other leg, and that foot will land on the other crank in the inside crank position (this foot will be facing the opposite direction as your other foot) then roll a half revolution backwards
