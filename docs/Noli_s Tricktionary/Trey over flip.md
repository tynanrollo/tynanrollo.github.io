notes: The naming convention of overflips don't make sense as it doesn't describe the trick directly, but it is generally accepted that a trey over flip is 360 unispin + over flip. When you want to specify a flip in the first part of the trick, simply add "flip". Eg Trey flip underflip = trey flip + underflip.
