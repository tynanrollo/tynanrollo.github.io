definition: No footer, hand initiates tire rotation, wheel does one backwards rotation, feet land on pedals. There are two versions of the trick: 1) begin and end seat in, hand reaches in front of the frame crown on the uni and "slaps" the tire to initiate backwards rotation. This is similar to how a regular hand flip is done. 2) begin and end seat out, hand reaches behind the frame crown and grabs the tire to initiate backwards rotation. This is similar to how a Hot Dog Flip is done.
