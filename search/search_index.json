I've been unicycling since Sept 19th, 2021 (Almost 3 years as of when I am writing this) when I discovered my college club (CPUC) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Since then, I have consumed years worth of unicycle YouTube content, attended every possible NAUCC and Muni Weekend, managed the club Instagram, served as CPUC club president in 2023-24, and coordinated the first Memorial Day Unicycle Weekend event in CA.</p> <p>I would say my signature trick is coasting, which I continue to refine and will hopefully truly master one day. This had been a dream trick for me since the very beginning, and it has fundamentally shaped by journey thus far. </p> <p>I couldn't have possibly reached where I am today without help from my fellow club members, local riders, NAUCC/Muni Weekend participants, and the online unicycling community. Hopefully through the Uni Bible, I can give back some of the hype, encouragement, and advice I have received.</p>"},{"location":"About/About/#where-to-find-me","title":"Where to find me","text":"<p>Feel free to reach out to me or check out some of my riding on instagram or YouTube.

If allowed, you can pick spots on the inside of the track.</li> <li>Over the course of the day, riders will learn to go to the \u201con deck spot\u201d to gather and then move up to the \u201cnext up, ready to race\u201d spot. The 800m is a long race so you have time to get the pattern down with the riders and go over the instructions slowly with each group. During the day, the heats go faster and it sometimes makes sense to have three groups lined up.</li> </ul> <p>With Each Heat of Riders</p> <ul> <li>Check in each rider against the list on the website. Verify that that their lane sticker is visible and matches the heat information list.</li> <li>Check equipment of each rider-helmet, gloves, kneepads, tied laces, \u201chead-hands-knees-shoes.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Repeat Instructions with Each Group Per the rulebook, it is a racer\u2019s responsibility to know these rules.</p> <ul> <li>Line up in your lane. Line up wheel behind line.</li> <li>Once the countdown begins, the wheel must stay stationary, do not roll back-and-forth or hop. During count down, no wheel movement. Must stay still, no hopping, no movement!</li> </ul> <p>A false start is crossing over line before gun. The front of the tire is what determines crossing the line. A second gunshot indicates a false start. For a false start come back to starting line. If somebody has two false starts, they're DQed.</p> <p>For the 800m race, it\u2019s okay to come off and remount uni. In other races, you cannot dismount. If you come off, walk around the track in your lane so you are on camera and tell official. Do not just leave the track. For the waterfall start, riders can go in to the inside lane as soon as safe, just don't take someone out.
